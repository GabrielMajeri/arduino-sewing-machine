Developed as a final project for the Introduction to Robotics course
by [Unibuc Robotics](https://www.facebook.com/unibuc.robotics/).

## Models

- [Interior Mechanism](models/SewingMachineMeasured.f3d)

## Code

The Arduino [code](code/code.ino) for the project is very simple since the sewing machine
currently doesn't have any additional features besides the core mechanism.
